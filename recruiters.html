      <p> Hey guys </p>
      <p> I know you guys are working hard, trying to make your commissions and pay your rents. But please
          try and see things from my perspective.</p>
      <p> I'm a moderately skilled, moderately experienced developer in SF, during the single biggest hiring
          boom in the history of software. It is not difficult -at all- for me to get a job. I have a ton of
          friends in non-tech who could really really use help finding positions. If you'd like to help them
          out, I'll refer you to them in a heartbeat. </p>
      <p> Under normal circumstances, I'd be welcome to leads. The worst that can happen is that I say no. 
          But the thing is that you are not the only recruiter who will contact me. </p>
      <p> I typically get contacted by, on average, one recruiter a day. The vast majority of recruiters
          give me the same handful of leads, while loudly claiming that they're using their great network
          of connections to give me leads I wouldn't get anywhere else. </p>
      <p> Additionally, it's very obvious that you guys have invested close to zero time. Most of the recruiters
          who contact me have done keyword searches, either on linkedin or google. </p>
      <p> For example, I often get job leads in tech stacks I'm uninterested in (say, .net) or industries I won't
          work in (game development), because I happen to match a search for the right words. Yet a cursory
          examination of my public repos, or even ten seconds of talking to me, would show that I actively avoid
          these things. </p>
      <p> Ultimately, what I'm trying to say is that you all seem to waste my time, and add little to no value
          to my career. And so I'm asking nicely: please don't. If you can add value, I'm interested. But if
          you're just going to take up space in my inbox, please please please don't.</p>
      <br />
      <p> If you're still reading this, and really want to contact me, please read this list of what I want
          out of my recruiter experience. </p>
