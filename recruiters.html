      <p> Hey guys </p>
      <p>
        I know you guys are working hard, trying to make your commissions and pay your rents. But please
        try and see things from my perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a moderately skilled, moderately experienced developer in SF, during the single biggest hiring
        boom in the history of software. It is not difficult -at all- for me to get a job. I have a ton of
        friends in non-tech who could really really use help finding positions. If you'd like to help them
        out, I'll refer you to them in a heartbeat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under normal circumstances, I'd be welcome to leads. The worst that can happen is that I say no.
        But the thing is that you are not the only recruiter who will contact me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I typically get contacted by, on average, one recruiter a day. The vast majority of recruiters
        give me the same handful of leads, while loudly claiming that they're using their great network
        of connections to give me leads I wouldn't get anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, it's very obvious that you guys have invested close to zero time. Most of the recruiters
        who contact me have done keyword searches, either on linkedin or google.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, I often get job leads in tech stacks I'm uninterested in (say, .net) or industries I won't
        work in (game development), because I happen to match a search for the right words. Yet a cursory
        examination of my public repos, or even ten seconds of talking to me, would show that I actively avoid
        these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, what I'm trying to say is that you all seem to waste my time, and add little to no value
        to my career. And so I'm asking nicely: please don't. If you can add value, I'm interested. But if
        you're just going to take up space in my inbox, please please please don't.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you're still reading this, and really want to contact me, please read this list of what I want
        out of my recruiter experience.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I will always talk to first party recruiters. If you're an employee of the company you're trying
          to recruite me to, I will make time for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Email me, do not phone me. When you phone me, you impose yourself upon me at your own convenience,
          and at the expense of mine. That's not fair! We haven't even met yet!
        </li>
        <li>
          Respect my timelines. If you see that I just took a new job a month ago, maybe don't try to headhunt me.
          As an aside, I came to my current job in July 2013
        </li>
        <li>
          I have no hiring authority at my company, and they already have recruiters that they use. Please don't
          try to place candidates with me. I'm <em>not allowed</em> to accept, so it puts me in a difficult position
          when you try to sell me on your services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Offer to meet up with me, go out for coffee, drinks, or food. How can you know where I'd be a good match
          if you don't even know me. And the best way to get to know someone is over tea. Hell, you don't have to pay,
          just attend. Plus this gives me an easy way to verify that you are actually nearby, and not a guy calling me 
          out of LA while pretending you're here.
        </li>
        <li>
          You have to bring something more to the table than "SOMA startup". There's a ton of those, and I'd get an interview
          just by walking in their front door.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't lie to me or disrespect my intelligence. I know how to search the internet for data. Don't tell me that it's
          unreasonable for me to expect to make 80k as a Rails developer with 3 years of experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          Respect my location. I would like to live and work in SF. Not anywhere else. I don't know why you think I'd take a job
          in rural Ohio, but I'm not interested, sorry.
        </li>
        <li>
          Above all: <em><strong>Add Value</strong></em>. Many recruiters simply spam me with whatever opportunities they currently
          have. Please don't do this. I can already go to a job board and look at those if I want to. If you can't definitively
          say why I would like this job more than another job, AND why this job is more appropriate for me than for someone else,
          you probably haven't done enough homework.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> For your convenience, here's a list of my priorities and career goals for the moment </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It has to be substantially better than my current job. If I haven't explicitly contacted you first, that means
          I'm happy where I am. And since every job hop runs the risk of DHS denying my work visa. So it has to be much
          better than my current position.
        </li>
        <li>
          I value being able to walk/bike to work. And I currently live in SF. If I have to commute more than 30 minutes by bike,
          I'm not interested. That means no Peninsula, no South Bay, no East Bay. Sorry.
        </li>
        <li>
          I highly value work/life balance. If your job would regularly require me to work more than 40hrs/week, no thanks.
          I understand crunch time, I understand being on call on occasion, I understand staying late to get something out.
          But if I'm regularly expected to stay past 5:30 (say, more than twice a month), that's a deal breaker. Note that
          I'm willing to take lower paying jobs in order to ensure I can leave at a reasonable hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          I know how much mid-to-senior Rails developers make, and my salary is healthily average. Do a Google search for
          "bay area rails salaries". If the number you have in mind isn't at the very least on par with what you find,
          you probably shouldn't bother.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm not terribly interested in equity. I can't pay my rent with stock, and I'm not wealthy enough to invest my time
          in a thing that -might- pay off. I'm also not interested in busting my ass to work for a startup. As an aside:
          if the company has more than 20 employees, they're not a startup anymore.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stereotypical bay area techie culture bores and annoys me. If you're trying to sell the startup experience, please don't.
          I don't want to work in an office filled with hipster dudes in polo shirts. I don't want to deal with sexist office banter.
          There are more hobbies than rock climbing and riding fixies. I'm deeply and personally disturbed by frivolous and irresponsible
          opulence. If you're just like everyone else, even though that might be great for others, it's not for me.
        </li>
        <li>
          My 1-3 years out life goal is to travel europe. Ideally while working remotely. While requiring my presence
          in the office is <strong>not</strong> a deal breaker, realize that if I don't have this flexibility available to me,
          I'll go looking for it once I'm ready.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I know this has probably come across as obnoxious, rude, maybe even entitled. But I get spammed and harassed by so many
        recruiters, that I needed to do something. "NO RECRUITERS PLEASE" beside my email address didn't help any.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're still with me, and after all of this still want to contact me, please email me at <a href="mailto:timherd+iamarecruiter@eqdw.net">this address</a>
        I will not respond to any recruiter who doesn't contact me through that link.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks, -eqdw</p>
